# Analysis Top 100 Movies on Netflix

This project involves using Jupyter Notebook and Python coding to analyze the top 100 movies on Netflix. The objective is to gain insights from the IMDb dataset available at "https://www.imdb.com/list/ls051601789/". The following steps were followed:
- Installing Python-3.11 and Jupyter Notebook
- Retrieving the relevant dataset from the IMDb URL using libraries such as "BeautifulSoup" and "pandas"
- Performing data cleaning to address symbols and spacing issues that could affect the analysis
- Developing Python code within the Jupyter Notebook for further analysis.

In this project, it used Jupyter Notebook and extracted different result by using Python coding to analysis Top 100 Movies on Netflix.

The movie years can be divided into different range groups. After cleaning up the data and removing the parentheses, the following results were obtained:
The most movies, a total of 60, were released between 1990-2010.
The second highest number of movies, 23 in total, were released between 2010-2020.
The third highest number of movies, 15 in total, were released between 1970-1990.
Therefore, the most common movie year range is between 1990-2010, followed by 2010-2020 and 1970-1990.
